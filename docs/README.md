# Sand-Box2D Documentation
This directory (hosted inside the game's repo)
contains everything you need to know about contributing to Sand-Box2D.

Let's get you around:
* [Build/](./build) - build instructions for each platform and some info about them.
* [Conventions](./conventions.md) - various conventions for naming files/classes/etc.
Also refer to this file if you want to write platform-specific code.
