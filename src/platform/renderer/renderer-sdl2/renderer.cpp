/**
 * @brief SDL2 Implementation for Renderer.
 * 
 * Implements a renderer with SDL2 window and its SDL2_renderer.
 * 
 * This way, we use SDL2 functions to render textures
 * or more graphical stuff with SDL2_gfx.
 * 
 * For the moment, it's the only renderer implementation for the game
 * (GLFW / OpenGL and Metal might appear later).
